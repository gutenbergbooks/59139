IRVIN COBB--THE MAN WHO STAYED DISCOVERED: Being Some Extracts from an
Appreciation by Robert H. Davis in the New York _Sun_, October 19, 1912.

It is not for me to indicate when the big events in his life will occur
or to lay the milestones of the route along which he will travel. I
know only that they are in the future, and that, regardless of any of
his achievements in the past, Irvin Cobb has not yet come into his own.

       *       *       *       *       *

I know of no single instance where one man has shown such fecundity and
quality as Irvin Cobb has so far evinced, and it is my opinion that at
fifty his complete works will contain more good humor, more good short
stories, and at least one bigger novel than the works of any other
single contemporaneous writer.

       *       *       *       *       *

One is impressed not only with the beauty and simplicity of his
prose, but with the tremendous power of his tragic conceptions and
his art in dealing with terror. There appears to be no phase of human
emotion beyond his pen. Without an effort he rises from the level
of actualities to the high peaks of boundless imagination, invoking
laughter or tears at will.

       *       *       *       *       *

He writes in octaves, striking instinctively all the chords of humor,
tragedy, pathos, and romance with either hand. Observe this man, in his
thirty-seventh year, possessing gifts the limitations of which even he
himself has not yet recognized.

       *       *       *       *       *

There seem to be no pinnacles along the horizon of the literary future
that are beyond him. If he uses his pen for an Alpine stock, the
Matterhorn is his.

Some critics and reviewers do not entirely agree with me concerning
Cobb; _but they will_.

_By Sinclair Lewis_


A man has to be not only famous but well-beloved before the little
facts of his biography become known to any one but his mother and his
aunts. Voltaire and Rousseau are useful persons to whom to refer when
you are dragged to a talk-party, but you feel no burning curiosity
as to where they were born or what editorial page saw their first
effusions. It is Robert Louis Stevenson whose home in Samoa you
photograph; whose refuge in Monterey you visit. And so it is with Irvin
S. Cobb, who is three things: a big reporter, a big writer, and a big
man.

If there is a newspaperman in New York who says that he doesn’t know
that Cobb was born in Paducah, Kentucky, in 1876; that his first
newspaper work was on the _Paducah Daily News_, that he did the Goebel
murder trial, moved to Louisville, came to New York and stole a job on
the _Evening Sun_, then that newspaperman is one of the I-knew-him-when
club, whose family name is Legion and whose middle name is occasionally
Liar. To be a New York newspaperman it is necessary to know Doc Perry’s
and the fact that Cobb was born in Paducah.

There’s a reason for it other than the fact that Cobb is a big writer
and a well-beloved man. That is: Cobb has made Paducah, and all the
other Paducahs--in Kentucky, and Minnesota, and California, and
Vermont--from which the rest of us came, live for us, in fiction which
gets us as no foreign tale ever can. He makes one smell the soil--a
thing that has been said of him so often that it is a platitude.

Covering the Portsmouth Peace Conference for the _Sun_, writing
humorous stuff for the _Evening World_, making a national reputation
for straight reporting with his account of the Thaw trial, Irvin Cobb
had developed into a good, dependable star reporter when suddenly
he broke away and in a story in the _Saturday Evening Post_, a
story called “The Escape of Mr. Trimm,” he made himself known as
a probable genius. No one could tell, yet, but in that story, the
dramatic structure of it, the words like sparks from a third-rail
in a snow-storm, the intensity with which the author saw himself as
the chief character of the tale, there was evidenced a new American
genius. Lord knows we needed him. We had--we still have--been letting
England and France and Kulturland beat us ten to one in fiction. We
had--we still have--a number of expert penmen who could do well with
a wealthy young Yale grad. in a motor car; others, largely feminine,
who could cheer our hearts with sweet stories about the Little Woman
Who Always Smiled. But where were the writers who could go out on the
street, really see the folks going by, and present them truthfully and
interestingly in fiction? With one lone short story, Cobb had elected
himself as one member of that missing and much needed class of geniuses.

Stories of the South followed; other stories, too, of New York. The
mere list of them, as they appear in the two books called “Back Home”
and “The Escape of Mr. Trimm” is enough to bring thrills to every
reader of fiction: The Belled Buzzard, An Occurrence up a Side Street,
Another of Those Cub Reporter Stories, Smoke of Battle, The Exit of
Anse Dugmore, Fishhead; Words and Music, Five Hundred Dollars Reward,
Up Clay Street, The Mob from Massac, Black and White, and the rest....
“Words and Music,” the first story in “Back Home” might be used as a
test for the Americanism of anybody. It’s a seditious, Confederate,
Southern story, but anybody, Yank or Southerner, who doesn’t thrill to
it, doesn’t feel all the old traditions of the real country when he
reads it, is a fake-American, a person of hyphenation.

Meanwhile, writing these slices of authentic genius, Cobb was not
forgetting his humor, and he decorated the _Saturday Evening Post_
with improper references to stomachs and dentists and vittles and art,
published in book form as “Cobb’s Anatomy,” and “Cobb’s Bill-of-Fare,”
then with irreverent things about the tourists and real-estate artists
from the Grand Canyon to San Francisco, published as “Roughing It De
Luxe,” and still more irreverent things about the grand old game of
doing the American tourist, published in “Europe Revised.”

And then the Great War, and Cobb’s account of it in “Paths of Glory.”

I have listed his books at such length--because they are at such
length. Here is Cobb, aged only thirty-nine, a mere child in the game.
A few years ago everybody was surprisedly saying that he was a good
fellow, fished discriminatingly, told edifying tales, was a friend
of Bob Davis and George Horace Lorimer and Sam Blythe, was not very
handsome, but was one of the few big newspapermen in whose records
there wasn’t one single black spot, one single case of meanness or
pettiness or failure in sympathy. The diagnosis was usually wound
up, “He will be a big writer.” That is, to-day, no proper ending for
this scholarly biography of Cobb, for he _is_ a big writer, and his
permanent place depends upon his written word.

There is nothing in the world pleasanter than meeting nice people,
and by nice people I mean in the case of men, good-tempered and
entertaining people. Women, to be really nice, must also be good
looking. An author--it is to this tribe that Mr. Cobb belongs--gives
us the pleasure of meeting him twice; meeting him twice, that is to
say, for the first time. I met Mr. Cobb in a train between Chicago and
Memphis, a vile train which went through maybe a dull country. Mr. Cobb
was the one redeeming feature of the journey. I had him in my bag and
I fought for the possession of him with my wife. He was nicely bound
and there were more than 200 pages of him. The next occasion on which I
met Mr. Cobb for the first time was at an afternoon party. It was quite
as dull as the railway journey until--a foolish person insisted on my
making a speech and then on another man making a speech. That shows how
dull the party was. Then the same person, turned suddenly wise, said
that Mr. Cobb was to tell stories, and he did. The party was not dull
any more. That was the second of my two first meetings with Mr. Cobb.
I met the author and I met the man. There was no disappointment about
either meeting.

I have been asked to write “an appreciation” of Irvin S. Cobb. I
appreciate Cobb, but if I appreciate him too much he will raise his
prices, and if I appreciate him too little he will seek an editor who
understands the artistic temperament, so I appreciate him just enough.
I appreciate him because he makes laughter; because he makes tears; and
because he makes circulation. But most of all I appreciate him because
he is the only man writing for the magazines who was not discovered by
Robert Harding Davis. As Editor of the _Paducah Bugle_, Cobb was the
first man to discover and appreciate Irvin S. Cobb. To-night he sits
among us a monumental example of apt appreciation’s artless aid.

I can imagine nothing more superfluous than giving a dinner to Irvin
Cobb, regarded from the viewpoints of nourishment, nutrition and waist
measurement. If, however, there is some idea in the proceeding of
giving the lie to the ancient calumny that no one loves a fat man, then
the occasion may serve a useful purpose. If it goes still further and
seeks to establish affirmatively that every one loves one particular
fat man, I heartily endorse the undertaking. If this is the theory, a
number of dinners should be given to Irvin Cobb, and I should be glad
to attend every one of them.

  I hate like the devil to drop into verse
  Because hardly a chap can do it much worse:
  Still prose sounds so dull when your mind lights on Cobb
  And the writer of verse has some chance with the job;
  For if ever a chap breathed forth sunlight and wit
  And could write and then talk as if they were nit
  And wooed you, and held you and made you first gulp
  And tighten the throat and made you like pulp
  Just to turn you to laughter until your sides ache,--
  It’s Cobb: bless his heart and his wit: and I ask him to take
  This rotten attempt to bid him God-speed
  In taking the world and his wife in those paths
  Where laughter and smiles still hang on the trees
  And fun goes with sunshine, like the heart of a child!

an all-around star he stands alone.

To-night, as I look at Mr. Cobb, aglow with all that tailor, laundry,
barber and friendship can do for man, I find it hard to realize that
this is the same Mr. Cobb I saw one day last August in Belgium.

Time had not dealt gently with him that day. The sun of his smile had
set early in the forenoon. His beard was several days gone. His raiment
was an affront to at least three of the five senses and all that was
left of his spirit was the droop.

He had eaten nothing for a long time, his feet were sore, and he was so
chafed that he emanated sparks at every step.

Even in a land as rich in ruins as Belgium, he stood out a conspicuous
masterpiece of wreckage.

The homeless Belgians pitied him!

Late in the evening, after several hours of brooding silence, he gave
utterance to the following statement:

“I wish I was back in New York, just sitting down to a good square meal
with some friends.”

And so to-night it is pleasant to realize that virtue is at least
triumphant and that his wish has come true.

Monumental on a boot cleaning stand, he is equally interested in cigars
and in assassinations, and he likes to wear his thinnest clothes in
winter. His stories are always reliable, even when they deal with the
British War Office. After annexing Broadway he took Belgium and his
book thereon is history. He sees straight and writes straight, and I am
his friend and his fan.

Irvin Cobb leads his league in everything but base running. He went to
the Belgian battle-fields equipped as a war correspondent with a facile
pen, a sense of humor, and a wonderful repertoire of darkey stories. He
came back with a neutral dialect, a reputation enhanced by the depth
and sincerity of his writing, and the mantles of Archibald Forbes and
Bennett Burleigh combining to cover--at least--portions of him.

We have long appreciated the corn of the South whose bright kernels,
properly distilled, make brighter Colonels still. Yet when before
have we worshipped the Cobb of the South? Here, surely, is all the
brightness and all the stimulation--and all the nourishment which a fat
land can give to a lean and hungry world. More joy comes from one Cobb
than from 1,000,000,000 bushels of corn--and although he is rare, in
one sense, in another he may be ranked as the South’s largest output.

all--at least not in our set. Shall we blame the Germans for this, or
is Old Irv slipping? From my heart, I ask you to reason with him.

Irvin is a true humorist in that he knows when not to be funny.
In addition to numberless works of irresistible joviality, he has
contributed to American literature some of its most serious notes,
including stories of pathos and also of gruesome power, almost
unrivalled. He has written important essays on food, too, one on
Southern cooking, in particular, that is as savory as Charles Lamb’s
“Dissertation on Roast Pig.” We are safe in hailing Cobb as already a
classic.

Everybody reads and rejoices in Cobb’s printed self. Those who know the
man love him and rejoice in his society. “Cobb’s Anatomy” is for the
general public. His heart is the biggest part of him, and if that were
not true, this unusual dinner would not be given. It takes more than a
great writer to earn great affection.

A big brain needs a big belly to balance it.

Irvin Cobb has a well-balanced brain.

He’s never top-heavy and never will be.

In all the years he wrote for the _Sunday World_ he never was late
turning in his copy, reaching the pay-window, going to luncheon, buying
a drink, laughing at his own jokes or demanding a raise in salary.

In his New York career he has made only three mistakes in judgment:
his house in Park Hill, the play he wrote, and leaving the _World_.
The first he _may_ sell, the second he can live down, but the third is
irreparable,--if not to him, assuredly to us.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
