<h2 class="nobreak">IRVIN COBB&mdash;THE MAN WHO STAYED
DISCOVERED: Being Some Extracts from an
Appreciation by Robert H. Davis in the New York
<i>Sun</i>, October 19, 1912.</h2></div>

<p>It is not for me to indicate when the big events in his life will
occur or to lay the milestones of the route along which he
will travel. I know only that they are in the future, and that,
regardless of any of his achievements in the past, Irvin Cobb
has not yet come into his own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I know of no single instance where one man has shown such
fecundity and quality as Irvin Cobb has so far evinced, and it
is my opinion that at fifty his complete works will contain more
good humor, more good short stories, and at least one bigger
novel than the works of any other single contemporaneous
writer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One is impressed not only with the beauty and simplicity of his
prose, but with the tremendous power of his tragic conceptions
and his art in dealing with terror. There appears to be
no phase of human emotion beyond his pen. Without an effort
he rises from the level of actualities to the high peaks of boundless
imagination, invoking laughter or tears at will.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He writes in octaves, striking instinctively all the chords of
humor, tragedy, pathos, and romance with either hand. Observe
this man, in his thirty-seventh year, possessing gifts the
limitations of which even he himself has not yet recognized.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There seem to be no pinnacles along the horizon of the literary
future that are beyond him. If he uses his pen for an
Alpine stock, the Matterhorn is his.</p>

<p>Some critics and reviewers do not entirely agree with me concerning
Cobb; <i>but they will</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">C&mdash;O&mdash;B&mdash;B</h2></div>

<p class="center"><i>By Sinclair Lewis</i></p>


<p>A man has to be not only famous but well-beloved before the
little facts of his biography become known to any one but his
mother and his aunts. Voltaire and Rousseau are useful persons
to whom to refer when you are dragged to a talk-party,
but you feel no burning curiosity as to where they were born
or what editorial page saw their first effusions. It is Robert
Louis Stevenson whose home in Samoa you photograph; whose
refuge in Monterey you visit. And so it is with Irvin S. Cobb,
who is three things: a big reporter, a big writer, and a big man.</p>

<p>If there is a newspaperman in New York who says that he
doesn&#8217;t know that Cobb was born in Paducah, Kentucky, in
1876; that his first newspaper work was on the <i>Paducah Daily
News</i>, that he did the Goebel murder trial, moved to Louisville,
came to New York and stole a job on the <i>Evening Sun</i>,
then that newspaperman is one of the I-knew-him-when club,
whose family name is Legion and whose middle name is occasionally
Liar. To be a New York newspaperman it is necessary
to know Doc Perry&#8217;s and the fact that Cobb was born in
Paducah.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a reason for it other than the fact that Cobb is a big
writer and a well-beloved man. That is: Cobb has made
Paducah, and all the other Paducahs&mdash;in Kentucky, and Minnesota,
and California, and Vermont&mdash;from which the rest of
us came, live for us, in fiction which gets us as no foreign tale
ever can. He makes one smell the soil&mdash;a thing that has been
said of him so often that it is a platitude.</p>

<p>Covering the Portsmouth Peace Conference for the <i>Sun</i>, writing
humorous stuff for the <i>Evening World</i>, making a national
reputation for straight reporting with his account of the Thaw
trial, Irvin Cobb had developed into a good, dependable star
reporter when suddenly he broke away and in a story in the
<i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, a story called &#8220;The Escape of Mr.
Trimm,&#8221; he made himself known as a probable genius. No
one could tell, yet, but in that story, the dramatic structure of
it, the words like sparks from a third-rail in a snow-storm, the
intensity with which the author saw himself as the chief character
of the tale, there was evidenced a new American genius.
Lord knows we needed him. We had&mdash;we still have&mdash;been
letting England and France and Kulturland beat us ten to one
in fiction. We had&mdash;we still have&mdash;a number of expert penmen
who could do well with a wealthy young Yale grad. in a
motor car; others, largely feminine, who could cheer our
hearts with sweet stories about the Little Woman Who Always
Smiled. But where were the writers who could go out on the
street, really see the folks going by, and present them truthfully
and interestingly in fiction? With one lone short story,
Cobb had elected himself as one member of that missing and
much needed class of geniuses.</p>

<p>Stories of the South followed; other stories, too, of New York.
The mere list of them, as they appear in the two books called
&#8220;Back Home&#8221; and &#8220;The Escape of Mr. Trimm&#8221; is enough
to bring thrills to every reader of fiction: The Belled Buzzard,
An Occurrence up a Side Street, Another of Those Cub
Reporter Stories, Smoke of Battle, The Exit of Anse Dugmore,
Fishhead; Words and Music, Five Hundred Dollars Reward,
Up Clay Street, The Mob from Massac, Black and White, and
the rest.... &#8220;Words and Music,&#8221; the first story in
&#8220;Back Home&#8221; might be used as a test for the Americanism of
anybody. It&#8217;s a seditious, Confederate, Southern story, but
anybody, Yank or Southerner, who doesn&#8217;t thrill to it, doesn&#8217;t
feel all the old traditions of the real country when he reads it,
is a fake-American, a person of hyphenation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, writing these slices of authentic genius, Cobb was
not forgetting his humor, and he decorated the <i>Saturday Evening
Post</i> with improper references to stomachs and dentists and
vittles and art, published in book form as &#8220;Cobb&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221;
and &#8220;Cobb&#8217;s Bill-of-Fare,&#8221; then with irreverent things about
the tourists and real-estate artists from the Grand Canyon to
San Francisco, published as &#8220;Roughing It De Luxe,&#8221; and still
more irreverent things about the grand old game of doing the
American tourist, published in &#8220;Europe Revised.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the Great War, and Cobb&#8217;s account of it in &#8220;Paths
of Glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have listed his books at such length&mdash;because they are at such
length. Here is Cobb, aged only thirty-nine, a mere child in
the game. A few years ago everybody was surprisedly saying
that he was a good fellow, fished discriminatingly, told edifying
tales, was a friend of Bob Davis and George Horace Lorimer
and Sam Blythe, was not very handsome, but was one of the
few big newspapermen in whose records there wasn&#8217;t one single
black spot, one single case of meanness or pettiness or failure
in sympathy. The diagnosis was usually wound up, &#8220;He will
be a big writer.&#8221; That is, to-day, no proper ending for this
scholarly biography of Cobb, for he <i>is</i> a big writer, and his
permanent place depends upon his written word.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the world pleasanter than meeting nice
people, and by nice people I mean in the case of men, good-tempered
and entertaining people. Women, to be really nice,
must also be good looking. An author&mdash;it is to this tribe that
Mr. Cobb belongs&mdash;gives us the pleasure of meeting him twice;
meeting him twice, that is to say, for the first time. I met Mr.
Cobb in a train between Chicago and Memphis, a vile train
which went through maybe a dull country. Mr. Cobb was the
one redeeming feature of the journey. I had him in my bag
and I fought for the possession of him with my wife. He was
nicely bound and there were more than 200 pages of him.
The next occasion on which I met Mr. Cobb for the first time
was at an afternoon party. It was quite as dull as the railway
journey until&mdash;a foolish person insisted on my making a speech
and then on another man making a speech. That shows how
dull the party was. Then the same person, turned suddenly
wise, said that Mr. Cobb was to tell stories, and he did. The
party was not dull any more. That was the second of my two
first meetings with Mr. Cobb. I met the author and I met
the man. There was no disappointment about either meeting.</p>

<p>I have been asked to write &#8220;an appreciation&#8221; of Irvin S.
Cobb. I appreciate Cobb, but if I appreciate him too much
he will raise his prices, and if I appreciate him too little he
will seek an editor who understands the artistic temperament,
so I appreciate him just enough. I appreciate him because he
makes laughter; because he makes tears; and because he makes
circulation. But most of all I appreciate him because he is
the only man writing for the magazines who was not discovered
by Robert Harding Davis. As Editor of the <i>Paducah Bugle</i>,
Cobb was the first man to discover and appreciate Irvin S.
Cobb. To-night he sits among us a monumental example of
apt appreciation&#8217;s artless aid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I can imagine nothing more superfluous than giving a dinner
to Irvin Cobb, regarded from the viewpoints of nourishment,
nutrition and waist measurement. If, however, there is some
idea in the proceeding of giving the lie to the ancient calumny
that no one loves a fat man, then the occasion may serve a
useful purpose. If it goes still further and seeks to establish
affirmatively that every one loves one particular fat man, I
heartily endorse the undertaking. If this is the theory, a
number of dinners should be given to Irvin Cobb, and I should
be glad to attend every one of them.</p>

<p>To-night, as I look at Mr. Cobb, aglow with all that tailor,
laundry, barber and friendship can do for man, I find it hard
to realize that this is the same Mr. Cobb I saw one day last
August in Belgium.</p>

<p>Time had not dealt gently with him that day. The sun of his
smile had set early in the forenoon. His beard was several
days gone. His raiment was an affront to at least three of the
five senses and all that was left of his spirit was the droop.</p>

<p>He had eaten nothing for a long time, his feet were sore, and
he was so chafed that he emanated sparks at every step.</p>

<p>Even in a land as rich in ruins as Belgium, he stood out a conspicuous
masterpiece of wreckage.</p>

<p>The homeless Belgians pitied him!</p>

<p>Late in the evening, after several hours of brooding silence,
he gave utterance to the following statement:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I was back in New York, just sitting down to a good
square meal with some friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so to-night it is pleasant to realize that virtue is at least
triumphant and that his wish has come true.</p>

<p>Irvin Cobb leads his league in everything but base running.
He went to the Belgian battle-fields equipped as a war correspondent
with a facile pen, a sense of humor, and a wonderful
repertoire of darkey stories. He came back with a neutral
dialect, a reputation enhanced by the depth and sincerity of
his writing, and the mantles of Archibald Forbes and Bennett
Burleigh combining to cover&mdash;at least&mdash;portions of him.</p>

<p>We have long appreciated the corn of the South whose bright
kernels, properly distilled, make brighter Colonels still. Yet
when before have we worshipped the Cobb of the South?
Here, surely, is all the brightness and all the stimulation&mdash;and
all the nourishment which a fat land can give to a lean and
hungry world. More joy comes from one Cobb than from
1,000,000,000 bushels of corn&mdash;and although he is rare, in one
sense, in another he may be ranked as the South&#8217;s largest
output.</p>

In addition to numberless works of irresistible joviality, he has

notes, including stories of pathos and also of gruesome power,
almost unrivalled. He has written important essays on food,
too, one on Southern cooking, in particular, that is as savory
as Charles Lamb&#8217;s &#8220;Dissertation on Roast Pig.&#8221; We are safe
in hailing Cobb as already a classic.</p>

<p>Everybody reads and rejoices in Cobb&#8217;s printed self. Those
who know the man love him and rejoice in his society.
&#8220;Cobb&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; is for the general public. His heart is the
biggest part of him, and if that were not true, this unusual
dinner would not be given. It takes more than a great writer
to earn great affection.</p>

<p>A big brain needs a big belly to balance it.</p>

<p>Irvin Cobb has a well-balanced brain.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s never top-heavy and never will be.</p>

<p>In all the years he wrote for the <i>Sunday World</i> he never was
late turning in his copy, reaching the pay-window, going to
luncheon, buying a drink, laughing at his own jokes or demanding
a raise in salary.</p>

<p>In his New York career he has made only three mistakes in
judgment: his house in Park Hill, the play he wrote, and leaving
the <i>World</i>. The first he <i>may</i> sell, the second he can live
down, but the third is irreparable,&mdash;if not to him, assuredly
to us.</p>
